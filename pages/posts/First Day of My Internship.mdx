sample_body: "Hello guys!! Recently, while working on a project, I came accross a situation where I needed to implement Drag and drop feature for uploading files to the server. But, the problem was that, the (component) file in which I was working was already large, so I wanted to somehow separate the drag and drop logic from my component logic, and I ended up creating a `useDragAndDrop()` hook."

The day I've been waiting for a long time has finally arrived! Today is the first day of my internship!


As I have mentioned in a previous post, I received a job offer from EchonLabs (Pvt) Limited. The starting date is today (30th June 2022). Yesterday my Human Resource Partner contacted me on WhatsApp to share the necessary information with me. She sent me a form to get the details to create my company email address. Then I received the instructions to set up my company email address.

Today morning my Human Resource Partner added me to a WhatsApp group with other trainees who joined today. She shared a document about the induction. It included some links to courses for trainees. She also shared with us the schedule for today. We had 3 sessions, 2 KT (Knowledge Transferring) sessions, and a session with our CEO.

Vurq app KT at 9.30 AM
ERP System KT at 11.00 AM
Tea with CEO at 1.30 PM
Vurq app KT
This session was conducted by an Associate PM/BA. Vurq is the app the employees must use to mark their attendance and tasks. We have a flexy hours work life. We must start before 10.00 AM and work for 8 hours a day. We must first 'Clock In'. Then we should start the timer before each task.
ERP System KT
This session was also conducted by an Associate PM/BA. EchonLabs has an ERP system that is used as the base system. This system is customized for the customer's requirements. She explains every functionality of this system. It was a bit confusing at first. We'll be familiar once we use this system for a while.
Tea with CEO
The final we had today was with our CEO. We had a friendly discussion and he asked us to introduce ourselves with basic information such as the town, university, what we're learning, and other facts such as the last movie we watched and our favorite food. Then he gave us an introduction to the company including its history and culture. The organization has a flat structure. He also told me the amount of course content I should complete within the first 2 weeks.

This concluded the first day of my internship...
