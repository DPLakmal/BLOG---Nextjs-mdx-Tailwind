Hello guys!!
Recently, while working on a project, I came accross a situation where I needed to implement Drag and drop feature for uploading files to the server. But, the problem was that, the (component) file in which I was working was already large, so I wanted to somehow separate the drag and drop logic from my component logic, and I ended up creating a `useDragAndDrop()` hook.<br />

In this article, I want to share exactly, how I created a custom hook for drag and drop feature. <br />

So, let's build it!! ðŸ”¥

Let me show you the end result of what we will be building.

### Initialize a React Project.

`npx create-react-app drag-and-drop-react --template typescript`

After the project is initialized, let's create a form in App.js.
